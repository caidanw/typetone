            <span>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</span>
            <span>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</span>
            <span>All mimsy were the borogoves,</span>
            <span>And the mome raths outgrabe.</span>
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            <span>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</span>
            <span>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</span>
            <span>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</span>
            <span>The frumious Bandersnatch!”</span>
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            <span>He took his vorpal sword in hand;</span>
            <span>Long time the manxome foe he sought—</span>
            <span>So rested he by the Tumtum tree</span>
            <span>And stood awhile in thought.</span>
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            <span>And, as in uffish thought he stood,</span>
            <span>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</span>
            <span>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,</span>
            <span>And burbled as it came!</span>
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            <span>One, two! One, two! And through and through</span>
            <span>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</span>
            <span>He left it dead, and with its head</span>
            <span>He went galumphing back.</span>
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            <span>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?</span>
            <span>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</span>
            <span>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”</span>
            <span>He chortled in his joy.</span>
          </p>

          <p class="stanza">
            <span>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</span>
            <span>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</span>

            <span>And the mome raths outgrabe.</span>
